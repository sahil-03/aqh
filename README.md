AQH = Attendance Quiz Helper <br>
Sometimes, I am too lazy to do the attendance quizzes for asynch classes. This does it for me. 

To run: 
1. Install dependencies.
2. Add OpenAI API key to your environment: `echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your api key here'" >> ~/.zshrc` + `source ~/.zshrc`
3. Run `python3 qa.py {path to mp3 or txt file}`.
4. Paste in the questions to get answers.
